# Rebuilds Assets.car and icon.icns from AppIcon.icon (Icon Composer format), as in Lookout.
# macOS 26 draws a light border around apps that only ship a legacy .icns, so the
# bundle also carries Assets.car, selected by CFBundleIconName in ../Info.plist.
# AppIcon.icon/Assets/background.png is the Hugeicons bandage glyph as a raised white band on a graphite background,
# rendered by `python3 make-icon.py` in this folder (needs Pillow).
# After regenerating it, run `pnpm tauri icon src-tauri/icons/AppIcon.icon/Assets/background.png` from the project root,
# delete the android and ios folders it adds, then run this script (tauri icon overwrites icon.icns).
